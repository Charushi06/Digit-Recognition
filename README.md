# Digit Recognition System

This project implements a **Digit Recognition System** using machine learning techniques to classify handwritten digits (0–9). The model is trained and evaluated using Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow/Keras.

The goal of this project is to accurately recognize digits from image data and analyze the model’s performance through evaluation metrics and visualizations.
